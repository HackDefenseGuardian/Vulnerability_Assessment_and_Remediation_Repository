# Vulnerability Assessment Report
*1st January 2024*

## System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful Intel Xeon processor and 128GB of DDR4 memory. It runs on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and hosts a MySQL 8.0 database management system. The server is connected to the network via IPv4 addresses and maintains SSL/TLS encrypted connections to ensure secure data transmission.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment covers the current access controls of the system. The assessment period spans from June 2023 to August 2023. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines are utilized to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
The database server is crucial for the organization as it stores and manages sensitive data critical for operational and strategic activities. Securing this data is paramount to protect confidential information, uphold customer trust, and comply with regulatory standards. Any disruption to the server could adversely impact business operations, leading to financial losses and reputational damage. This vulnerability assessment aims to identify and mitigate potential security weaknesses to ensure the server's integrity, availability, and confidentiality.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source        | Threat Event                               | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Hackers              | Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks     | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Malicious Software   | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration| 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Power Outages        | Disrupt mission-critical operations         | 2          | 2        | 4    |

## Approach
In this qualitative vulnerability assessment, the selection of specific threat sources—Hackers, Malicious Software, and Power Outages—was based on their potential to significantly disrupt business operations and cause substantial harm. Hackers pose a critical risk due to their capability to steal sensitive information, potentially leading to financial losses and reputational harm. Malicious Software, such as ransomware, can compromise server integrity, resulting in data corruption and unauthorized access. Although Power Outages are non-human threats, they can lead to server downtime, interrupting critical business processes and causing operational inefficiencies. These threats were chosen for assessment due to their high likelihood and severe impact on business continuity.

## Remediation Strategy
To mitigate the risk of hackers conducting DoS attacks and obtaining sensitive information, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) alongside robust firewall configurations can enhance access security and restrict unauthorized access attempts. To defend against malicious software, enforcing strict endpoint protection measures and regularly updating antivirus software can minimize the risk of malware infiltration and data exfiltration. For power outage resilience, deploying uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and establishing comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plans ensure continuous server operation during electrical disruptions, mitigating potential downtime and data loss risks. These security measures align with identified threats and reinforce the overall security posture of the information system.
